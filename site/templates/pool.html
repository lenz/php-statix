<? $title = "The Pool" ?>

<h1><?= $title ?></h1>
<img src="/images/pool.png" style="border: solid 3px silver" />
<p>This is it. Refreshing, isn´t it?</p>

<h2>How about some tests?</h2>
<p>Let´s try these denormalized and wrong links to the other pools!</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Denormalized Links get normalized: <a href="/oTHer/PoOls">/oTHer/PoOls</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Non existing URLs are always handled by php: <a href="/not-there/">/not-there/</a>
    </li>
</ol>
